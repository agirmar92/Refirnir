# Refirnir
## Introduction
Refirnir is a web application I created for me and a group of my friends (we call ourselves Refirnir) to maintain football matches we play. With the app we can create an event (football match) and others can then sign up for it. The creator of an event can assign signed up players to teams that will compete or let the app do it randomly. Facebook login is needed to sign in.
